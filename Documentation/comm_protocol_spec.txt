# Communication Protocol
############################
Brief Client Side: The request object is encoded in JSON and posted to the /request_handler.php page, then the response text is an object encoded in JSON, which can be evaluated as a JavaScript object.


NOTE: TO TEST THIS LOCALLY, you must run chromium-browser --disable-web-security

Google Chrome and Firefox probably have different commands. Make sure the browser is entirely
off before you try this. This allows the browser to make requests to the exscitech server
from a different domain (i.e. your local one).

Example code:
	
    function send_request(request_object, request_URL){
		//Make request
		var response= $.ajax({
		    url: request_URL,
		    type: 'POST',
		    data: JSON.stringify(request_object),
		    async: false
		}).responseText;
	
		//Turn the JSON response into an object and return it
		try{
		    return JSON.parse(response);
		} catch(err){
		    var ret = Object();
		    ret.success = false;
		    ret.error = "JSON syntax error, invalid server response";
		    return ret;
		}
    }
    
    var request_obj = Object();
	request_obj.request_type = "login";
	request_obj.email = "sam@lol.com";
	request_obj.pw_hash = "1234dinosaur";
	send_request(request_obj, "/request_handler.php");
